You can use ELSA to upload contracts or any other kind of document that should get signed, to let everyone who relates to the document sign via ELSA. You can depend on ELSA for structuring the process of getting the signatures and for taking care of notification for each party that relates to your documents."
            },

                "question": "How does ELSA work?",
                "answer": "The core function of ELSA would be to enable everyone who works with it to easily give secure signatures. ELSA distingueshes beetween simple and advanced signatures. A simple signature is made by simply saving the e-mailadress of the user for the document, as it isn't necessarily as legaly binding as signing with a Pen on paper. An Advanced signature is more secure, as it uses kryptographic methods like generating a hashcode or encoding via rsa-procedure. If you have more detailed questions, please look some more at our faqs or ask an admin."

                "question": "Is it possible to make adjustments regaring my notifications?",
                "answer": "It is possible to adjust which kinds of notification-emails you want to receive. To do so, you should click on the avatar-icon in the upper-right corner and choose Account settings. Right at the bottom of your account-settings page, you can choose which kinds of email-reminders you want to receive. If you want more detailed information you can hover over the little 'i' icons on your settings page, or ask an admin."

We will send you a mail with a link and you should be able to choose a different password for your account, after clicking the same link. If you are in fact able to login, but you still want to change your password, you can do so by going to your Account settings and clicking \"Change Password\"."

            {
                "question": "What does it mean, that my account is locked?",
                "answer": "To secure the information regarding the documents that are uploaded by users, a newly registered user has to be validated and unlocked by an admin, before he or she can login with the account. It is possible that this is not the case for some users, if an admin has taken care of e-mailadresses that should be filtered. In that case there are e-maildomains, that allow the referring user to unlock his account, by simply validating the e-mailadress. For more information you should ask your admin."

                "answer": "After your login you can see your overviewpage, there you should click on the document or the envelope that contains the document you want to sign. After navigating to the documentview-page, you see a sidebar on the right with a button for signign the document. If you have to give an advanced signature you will be asked to give your public key for the signature."
            },
            {
                "question": "Which kinds of signatures does ELSA support?",
                "answer": "ELSA distinguishes between two different forms of digital signatures, which are both defined in the eIDAS regulation. There is the simple signature, which is made by saving the e-mailadress, the date and the time of the signature. This can be used as an indicator for seeing whether the user who should sign has seen the document and is content with it. The second form is the advanced signature, where the application uses the private key to encrypt the hash code of the document, a very long code which is specifically generated for each document. By using this method we can be sure, that we can trace the signature back to the user that made it under normal circumstances by decrypting the signature. An advanced signature is legally binding. If you want to include a picture of your written signature you can upload one or even make one by giving a written signature with your cursor in your account-settings. The picture will be included in the protocol of each document that you sign. Aside from the kinds of signatures you can also ask other users to review your document, which is technically the same as giving a simple signature, but if you ask at least one user to proofread, ELSA will only allow signatures if all reviewers have already done so. This way the process of getting the signatures for any document is structured in an optional proofreading-process and the process of signing the document. After that the document will be archived. Which kind of signature a user has to make is decided by the owner of the document."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is it possible to change a signature type in case I made a mistake and chose the wrong one?",
                "answer": "Yes, you can change all of the settings for a document whenever you want, but under different circumstances it can happen that the signatures that already have been made become invalid. Still this is no reason to worry, because ELSA will take care of that and notify all users that some changes have been made."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I set a date by which all signatures must be made?",
                "answer": "While uploading a document you are able to set deadline for the process of that document. When the deadline is arrived the process will be terminated if it isn't finished already and the document and all the relating information will be archived. ELSA will remind users that have to sign the document at a given time and if the document is still relevant after the deadline you will still be able to access all relating information."

                "answer": "ELSA saves each document inside of an envelope. This can start with a single document but an envelope can contain any number of documents and has the purpose to bundle those documents that relate to the same issue or to each other."
            },
            {

For more detailed information you should take a look at the sidebar on the right, where you will find the protocoll and more information by clicking \"Show metadata\"."

If you want to add more users to a document that already has been uploaded you can change the settings of that document by clicking on the gear icon on your overview page or on the \"Settings\" button in the sidebar of the documentpage."

                "answer": "Just like documents where the process has been finished or the deadline has been reached, old documents will be archived, but you won't find them in an envelope or on your overviewpage. Instead you can find them in the history of the new document version."

Beside smaller tasks, like the definition of the appearance of ELSA, or the definition of e-mail domains whose accounts should be activated automatically, an admin has for example also the task to activate new user accounts, which are not activated automatically. The possibility to do this can be found in the user administration, to which only users with the admin role have access. There you will also find other tools for user management, as well as the option, to make other users an admin, if necessary."

You can also create email templates that are used for the notifications of ELSA, or define the corporate design, i.e. the appearance of Elsa. In addition, you and the other admins are responsible for deciding which email address a user account must have in order to be used without the validation by an admin."
